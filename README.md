# NgxThree [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ngx-three.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ngx-three) ![Build](https://github.com/demike/ngx-three/workflows/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml/badge.svg)

NgxThree wraps [three.js](https://threejs.org/) in Angular components.
It allows to render 3d Scenes in a declarative way.

it uses code generation to be able to provide as much functionality from three js.
This approach makes it possible to follow three.js updates with minimal effort.

The project is inspired by the great [react three fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) library.

!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!
